    % Routine that computes the propellant rocket performance using the Infinite-Area-Chamber (IAC) model
    %
    % This method is based on the method outlined in Gordon, S., & McBride,
    % B. J. (1994). NASA reference publication, 1311.
    %
    % Args:
    %     obj (RocketSolver): RocketSolver object
    %     mix1 (Mixture): Properties of the initial mixture
    %
    % Optional Args:
    %     * mix2_c (Mixture): Properties of the mixture at the outlet of the chamber (previous calculation)
    %     * mix3 (Mixture): Properties of the mixture at the throat (previous calculation)
    %     * mix4 (Mixture): Properties of the mixture at the given exit points (previous calculation)
    %     * FLAG_PERFORMANCE (bool): Flag to compute rocket parameters (default = true)
    %
    % Returns:
    %     Tuple containing
    %
    %     * mix1 (Mixture): Properties of the initial mixture
    %     * mix2_c (Mixture): Properties of the mixture at the outlet of the chamber
