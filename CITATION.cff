    ## Main features
      - The code stems from the minimization of the free energy of the system by using Lagrange multipliers combined with a Newton-Raphson method, upon condition that initial gas properties are defined by two functions of states (e.g., temperature and pressure)
      - When temperature is not externally imposed, the code retrieves a routine also based on Newton-Raphson method to find the equilibrium temperature
      - Solve processes that involve strong changes in the dynamic pressure, such as detonations and shock waves in the steady state
      - Find the equilibrium conditions of the different phenomena undergoing behind the shock: molecular vibrational excitation up to dissociation, and electronic excitation up to ionization, thereby providing the `properties of the gas in plasma state` within the temperature range given by the NASA’s 9-coefficient polynomial fits.
      - Calculate the chemical equilibrium composition of a mixture by selecting which species can react or remain chemically frozen (inert).
      - The corresponding thermodynamic properties of the species are modelled with `NASA’s 9-coefficient polynomial fits`, which ranges `up to 20000 K`, and the ideal gas equation of state
      - Results are in `excellent agreement with NASA’s Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) program`, CANTERA and Caltech’s Shock and Detonation Toolbox, and TEA
    * `Chemical equilibrium problems`
      - TP: Equilibrium composition at defined temperature and pressure
      - HP: Adiabatic temperature and composition at constant pressure
      - SP: Isentropic compression/expansion to a specified pressure
      - TV: Equilibrium composition at defined temperature and constant volume
      - EV: Adiabatic temperature and composition at constant volume
      - SV: Isentropic compression/expansion to a specified volume
    * `Shock calculations:`
      - Pre-shock and post shock states
      - Equilibrium or frozen composition
      - Incident or reflected shocks
      - Chapman-Jouguet detonations and overdriven detonations
      - Reflected detonations
      - Oblique shocks/detonations
      - Shock/detonation polar curves for incident and reflected states
      - Hugoniot curves
      - Ideal jump conditions for a given adiabatic index and pre-shock Mach number
    * `Rocket propellant performance assuming:`
      - Infinite-Area-Chamber model (IAC)
      - Finite-Area-Chamber model (FAC)
    * All the routines and computations are encapsulated in a more comprehensive and `user-friendly GUI`
    * The code `is in it’s transition to Python`
    * Export results in a spreadsheet
    * Export results as a .mat format
    * `Display predefined plots` (e.g., molar fraction vs equilence ratio)
